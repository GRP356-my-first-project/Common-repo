          <p><b>Advantage:</b> The cups are biodegradable; they have the ability to decompose
            after interactions with biological elements.</br>
            
            <b>Benefit:</b> Reducing carbon footprint isn’t a story we keep on hearing from
            experts. With the regular use of biodegradable coffee cups in cafeterias, offices,
            homes, etc., the amount of carbon footprint also decreases. Prevailing
            apprehensions over climate change can’t be subdued dramatically. But we have
            the opportunity to conserve the earth by doing a small bit of good work. In
            simple words, saving the environment by reducing plastic waste.</p>
