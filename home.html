            <p><i>Ah, coffee; It might be the very first thing you think about in the morning. 
              But  what you don't think about: all the waste that comes along with that kick of  caffeine. 
              But it's more than just the cups and the lids that are creating waste. 
              What  about all those used-up coffee grounds? 
              Our main motivation comes from seeing  all those coffee grounds being thrown away.  
              What motivates us the most, is the desire to help reducing the amount of pollution caused by cups made by plastic. 
              As for example, Canada is ranked among the  most consuming coffee countries in the world with 247 thousand tons of coffee beans annually; I will let you imagine the quantity of plastic coffee cups used  daily. About 99% of paper, plastic, and foam coffee cups end up in the trash, and  once they're in the trash, even paper cups can take over 20 years to decompose.
              So, by recycling one waste stream, FOTW35 will help tackle a bigger one.</i></p>

            <p><i>Every day, a team of cyclists will travel to coffee shops throughout the city to collect  used coffee grounds.
              After picking up the coffee ground, it will take about 90 minutes until it's dropped off at the workshop. 
              For a courier company, this is not a  usual task. It is something that is pretty unique. 
              The collected grounds are then sorted and then cleaned at CUP-FFEE's workshop. 
              Then, they're transported to another facility where they're dried and blended with plant fibers, beechwood grains, and natural resins. 
              The ultimate goal is just to highlight the value of recycling and waste streams back to society. </i></p>
